# Telco Churn Project


# Project Description

### Telco is a telecommunications company that provides a number of services to include phone and internet. There has been a number of customers who have churned from Telco. In this project, I will delve into the different features of Telco and hone in on possible reasons why customers have decided to churn. 


# Business Goals

* Uncover drivers that are causing Telco customers to churn
* Use machine learning algorythms with drivers to hone in on possible reasons for customer churn.
* Develop an understanding of possible reasons customers are churning.

# Initial Thoughts

### My initial hypothesis is that customers who are churning are customers who's monthly total bill are high and are on a month-to-month contract.

# The Plan

* Acquire data from Sequel Ace DB

* Prepare Data
    * Remove unnecessary data to reduce noise
        * drop duplicates
        * customer id
        * payment type id
        * internet service type id
        * contract type id
    * Create new columns utilizing existing data
        * contract type
        * internet service type
        * payment type
    * Create a train, validate, and test dataset with a split of about 56/24/20. 

* Explore Data and uncover drivers
    * Answer initial questions
        *
        *
        *
        *

* Develop machine learning models
    * Utilize drivers in various machine learning models
    * Evaluate and refine models on train and validate data sets
    * Select best performing models
    * Use test data set on best models
